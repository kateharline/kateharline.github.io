Kate is a Plant Biology Ph.D. candidate in the School of Integrative Plant Science at Cornell University. Kate graduated from Washington University in St. Louis with an A.B. in Biology-Biochemistry and minors in computer science and ballet. </p> <p> Her research investigates developmental decision-making in the model plant Arabidopsis using imaging and gene expression approaches. At WashU she explored research in microbiology, ecology and structural biochemistry labs before honing in on her true passion for plant biology. She strives to cultivate interdisciplinary collaborations to discover the deep mechanistic similarities across the tree of life and harness new technologies to ask novel questions. </p><p>Kate hopes that the foundational mechanisms she works on will translate into sustainable agricultural solutions for the future. Kate also works to impact her community more directly through outreach activities like yearly science workshops she designs and hosts for aspiring women and minorities in STEM. Outside of the lab, Kate enjoys yoga and performing with a local modern dance group.  </p><p> Kate is a recipient of the NSF GRFP,  Presidential Life Sciences Fellowship, Ian D.W. Cramer Prize for Dance, Stanley Spector Memorial Award, Donald Danforth Plant Science Center REU Fellowship and Tyson Research Center Fellowship.
