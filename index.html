Kate is a Plant Biology Ph.D. candidate in the School of Integrative Plant Science at Cornell University. Currently, Kate investigates tissue and organ patterning mechanisms at the cellular level in the model plant Arabidopsis. Kate optimized plant culture, confocal imaging, image processing and gene expression quantification techniques to this end.  </p> <p>Kate completed her undergraduate education at Washington University in St. Louis, receiving an A.B. in Biology-Biochemistry and minors in computer science and ballet. At WashU she explored research in microbiology, ecology and structural biochemistry labs before honing in on her true passion for plant biology. She strives to cultivate interdisciplinary collaborations to discover the deep mechanistic similarities across the tree of life and harness new technologies to ask novel questions. </p><p>Kate hopes that the foundational mechanisms she works on will translate into sustainable agricultural solutions for the future. Kate also works to impact her community more directly through outreach activities like yearly science workshops she designs and hosts for aspiring women and minorities in STEM. Outside of the lab, Kate enjoys yoga and performing with a local modern dance group.  </p><p> Kate is a recipient of the NSF GRFP,  Presidential Life Sciences Fellowship, Ian D.W. Cramer Prize for Dance, Stanley Spector Memorial Award, Donald Danforth Plant Science Center REU Fellowship and Tyson Research Center Fellowship.
