<p>Kate is drawn to spatiotemporally complex biological phenomena. She likes to approach these problems through elegant and complementary design of biological experiments, data stewardship and analysis pipelines. Kate is currently most excited about efforts to build pragmatic knowledge of gene expression and gene product regulation. Kate ultimately is driven to uncover new solutions for human and planet health.</p>

<p>Kate attributes her interest in multi-scale biology and multi-dimensional data to her previous work. In her Ph.D., Kate investigated how cellular processes scale to organ wide phenotypes. Kate optimized plant culture, confocal imaging, image processing and gene expression quantification techniques to this end. Before her Ph.D., Kate engaged in microbiology, ecology, structural biochemistry and computer science research and development. </p>

<p>Kate actively seeks diverse perspectives, leadership and science communication opportunities including work as a graduate resident fellow for upperclassmen students, through regular science workshops she designed and hosted for aspiring women and minorities in STEM and participation in science communication, diversity and inclusivity training.  </p>

<p> Kate is a recipient of the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, Cornell Institute for Digital Agriculture Hackathon prize for ‘Greatest Societal Challenge’, Presidential Life Sciences Fellowship, Ian D.W. Cramer Prize for Dance, Stanley Spector Memorial Award (Essay), Donald Danforth Plant Science Center REU Fellowship and Tyson Research Center Fellowship.

<p>In her "free" time, Kate enjoys practicing yoga and dance, skiing, backpacking and running.</p>
