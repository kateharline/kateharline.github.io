<p>Kate aims to disentangle complex biological phenomena through the elegant and complementary design of biological experiments, data stewardship and analysis pipelines. She is driven to build a pragmatic understanding of gene expression and gene product regulation to ultimately uncover new solutions for human and planet health.</p>

<p>These interests were espoused in her previous work investigating how cellular processes scale to organ wide phenotypes. In her Ph.D., Kate optimized plant culture, confocal imaging, image processing and gene expression quantification techniques to this end. Before her Ph.D., Kate engaged in microbiology, ecology, structural biochemistry and computer science research and development. Pursuits to which she attributes her interest in multi-scale biology and multi-dimensional data. </p>

<p>Kate actively seeks diverse perspectives, leadership and science communication opportunities through work as a graduate resident fellow for upperclassmen students, through yearly science workshops she designs and hosts for aspiring women and minorities in STEM and regular participation in science communication, diversity and inclusivity training.  </p>

<p> Kate is a recipient of the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, Cornell Institute for Digital Agriculture Hackathon prize for ‘Greatest Societal Challenge’, Presidential Life Sciences Fellowship, Ian D.W. Cramer Prize for Dance, Stanley Spector Memorial Award (Essay), Donald Danforth Plant Science Center REU Fellowship and Tyson Research Center Fellowship.
