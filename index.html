Kate is a Plant Biology Ph.D. candidate in the School of Integrative Plant Science at Cornell University. Kate graduated from Washington University in St. Louis with an A.B. in Biology--Biochemistry and minors in computer science and ballet. Here she pursued research interests as diverse as microbiology, ecology and structural biochemistry before honing in on her true passion for plant biology. Her research now integrates developmental decision-making in the model plant Arabidopsis, synthetic biology and computational modeling. She enjoys working with collaborators outside of plant biology to discover the deep mechanistic similarities across the tree of life that inspire her. She hopes that the foundational mechanisms she works on will translate into sustainable agricultural solutions for the future. She also hopes to have an impact on her community through outreach activities including yearly science workshops she designs and hosts for aspiring women and minorities in STEM. Kate is a recipient of the NSF GRFP,  Presidential Life Sciences Fellowship, Ian D.W. Cramer Prize for Dance, Stanley Spector Memorial Award, Donald Danforth Plant Science Center REU Fellowship and Tyson Research Center Fellowship. Outside of the lab, Kate enjoys yoga and performing with a local modern dance group.
