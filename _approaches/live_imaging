Imaging flourescently tagged plant organs at regular intervals exposes the underlying cellular dynamics of growth. Distributions of growth directions, relative growth rates and rates of cellular proliferation all can be captured at the cellular level across the organ. This data can be used to fit models of growth dynamics and compare dysfunctional growth programs in mutant plants.
